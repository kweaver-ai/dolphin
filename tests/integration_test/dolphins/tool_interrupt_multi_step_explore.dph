Test multi-step explore block with interrupts and LLM continuation
This script tests that after interrupt and resume, the LLM can continue reasoning.

Available tools:
- high_risk_tool: Requires confirmation (param: string)
- safe_tool: Safe operation, no confirmation needed (param: string)
''' -> system_prompt

'''
Task: Perform the following operations in sequence:
1. First, call high_risk_tool with param="step1_operation"
2. After the first operation completes, analyze the result
3. Then call safe_tool with param="step2_operation" to complete the workflow
4. Finally, provide a summary of both operations

Please execute these steps carefully and provide detailed reasoning.
