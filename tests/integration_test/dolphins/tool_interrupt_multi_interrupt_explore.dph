'''
Test multiple interrupts in explore block with LLM continuation
This script tests multiple high-risk tool calls that each require confirmation.

Available tools:
- high_risk_tool: Requires confirmation (param: string)
- safe_tool: Safe operation, no confirmation needed (param: string)
''' -> system_prompt

'''
Task: Perform three operations:
1. Call high_risk_tool with param="first_operation"
2. After first completes, call high_risk_tool again with param="second_operation"
3. Finally, summarize both operations using safe_tool with param="summary"

Each high-risk operation requires careful confirmation.
